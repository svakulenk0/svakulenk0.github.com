Imagine: conversation as a ``token game’’, where token is like a ping-pong ball that keeps bouncing in-between the players from one side to the other as they switch turns.
Each player can either take the initiative with a pro-active move (attack) or reply to the maneuvre suggested by the opponent with a re-active move (defence).
Advanced players can also perform both moves in a single turn, i.e. receive the ball and initiate the new attack within the same maneuvre.
Let's see an example of how such a ping-pong dialogue could sound like:

- Hello! How are you today? (pro-active action)
- Good, thank you! (re-active action)
- Let's play ping-pong. (pro-active action)
- Sure. Do you have the rackets? (re-active + pro-active actions)

Such an example of a regular daily conversation illustrates the applicability of the ping-pong metaphor to the general conversational settings, in which each participant assumes an equal role in the conversation.
However it can be also used to describe other kinds of real-world conversations, and in particular the information-seeking conversations, which occur in the customer-service scenarios, such as library and shopping assistance services.
In this type of dialogues the roles of the conversation participants are not symetric.
One of the participants is regarded as the principal information seeker, while the other one is the principal information provider, who is there to help the seeker to satisfy the information need (<b>A</b>nswer the <b>Q</b>uestion).
The key, however, is that the conversation participants can switch roles in the process of the conversation, when the information provider can <b>R</b>equest additional information from the seeker to better understand the information need, and the seeker can provide intermediate <b>F</b>eedback to the provider as a support.
